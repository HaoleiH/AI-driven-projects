This notebook shows a method to extract data point position from certain color line plot. It only works for line plot will different colors and clear labels.

General procedures are:
1. extract pixel position of line with certain color in the graph.
2. find pixel position of the axis labels.
3. use axis label content and their pixel position to establish corresponding relationship between pixel positon and real coordinate.
4. use the established corresponding relationshp to convert line plot in pixel space to real space. 

## Limitations

This tool only works for plots with line color different than axis color. And the axis should have linear axis ticks and labels. Legend is also not handled.

## Future plan

1. add support for non labeled y axis and log scale axis.
2. preprocess the image to remove legend
3. add support for scatter plot.

## Results

find labels with paddle OCR
